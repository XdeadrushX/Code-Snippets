###File Listing

* `README.md` - This readme file.  
* `LICENSE.md` - The MIT license, all scripts are licensed under MIT in this directory.
* `crrpg` - A script written for a small community I reside in, won't serve much useful purpose.  
* `deprecated_all_purpose_script` - This script was meant to do everything I desired, containing handly aliases and the likes. My biggest script thus far. Being over 3,800 lines long and more than likely terribly inefficient. It was originally titled 'Revo's 42', but I called it deprecated all purpose script on Github because I think many people will consider this useless in entirety, and might just want to browse through it.  
* `easytags` - A list of aliases that improve readability when you need certain characters.  
* `hangman` - Obviously, a hangman script. May or may not fully work. I don't remember.  
* `highlight` -  My own Highlight script.  
* `kickrejoin` - A script which allows you to rejoin only specific channels (Written because some networks disallow autorejoin), enable log-reloading in mIRC itself if you want to review previous conversation on a kick.  
* `popups.mrc` - The popups file in .mrc file format. This is a modification of the normal popups file found in ctrl+r->popups  
* `popups.ini` - The popups file in .ini file. This is a modification of the normal popups file found in ctrl+r->popups.  
* `queryrelay` - Relay queries to active channel or most active channels depending on how you adjust the script.  
* `quotescript` - This was primarily written by a friend of mine, I've used it for a long while and had lots of fun adding quotes.  
* `raw-alterations` - This script contains all ON RAW events, it alters a few whoises to provide more information and some more small changes.
* `rockpaperscissors` - A Rock Paper Scissors game.  
* `search_logs` - A sole alias that searches the logs of your active channel for `[search]`.  
* `slapback` - A script that slaps someone back if they slap you.  
* `utils` - Various scripts that serve no real purpose but to help you do things quicker.

### Additional elaboration

Some scripts may contain restrictions to networks (`if ($network == network) {`), many of these scripts were customised to my own liking, or released for specific communities, to reduce annoyance on other networks, you might have to remove or alter them.
